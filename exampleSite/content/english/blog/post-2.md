What do you need? You have two options

* A computer and microphone
* A mobile phone

After that, you can start to think about the recording location. Choose a quiet room and place yourself near soft furnishings and avoid placing your mic near hard surfaces or windows.

If you are recording from your computer we recommend you to use the software that you are using already to record vocals if you are already into recording yourself, if you are not into this we recommend you to use [Bandlab](https://www.bandlab.com/ "Bandlab") on the app or desktop version. It's free.

Place your microphone at 5 or 6 inch away from your mouth and start! If you are recording with your computer you can add the beat file that we are working on if you already have it or just use the metronome in the computer, grab your headphones and start. If you are using your mobile phone just use a reference track or metronome from Bandlab using headphones. Any kind of headphones will work fine.

If you are planning to get a mic maybe this one is a good starting point [http://bit.ly/cheap_mic](http://bit.ly/cheap_mic "http://bit.ly/cheap_mic")

And if you want to get one even more expensive just go for that. Just make sure that the microphone has a cardioid polar pattern option, that is the best for vocals.

After recording _send me just the vocal track in “.wav 24bit” format without reverb or any audio fx_ at [ghostieproducer@protonmail.com](mailto:ghostieproducer@protonmail.com) or share it with my email via Bandlab.
